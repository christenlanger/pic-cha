This is an app that facilitates a picture game.

- The settings and gameboard is defined in config.json
- All images should go inside the theme folder defined in the config ("default" by default).
- Extra style.css inside the theme folder will apply its own CSS rules.

As of now the app has basic functionality. Triggers will be added in the next update.

Run the app:

1. git clone https://github.com/christenlanger/pic-cha.git
2. cd pic-cha
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

First release will be when the app is feature-complete.
